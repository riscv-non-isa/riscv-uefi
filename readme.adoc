= RISC-V UEFI PROTOCOL Specification

RISC-V Platforms need special UEFI Protocols. The discussion of such
requirements occurs on the https://lists.riscv.org/g/tech-unixplatformspec[RISC-V Unix Platform Mailing
list]. It is publicly readable but posting requires being a member of the
RISC-V Foundation. Any new UEFI Protocol needs to be discussed and approved
there before being merged. Once approved in RISC-V community, it can be
added/referenced to the UEFI spec maintained by UEFI forum.

= Building Documents

The final specification in form of PDF and HTML can be generated using
`make` command. The `makefile` internally uses asciidoctor so the packages
required by the `makefile` need to be installed on the build system.
